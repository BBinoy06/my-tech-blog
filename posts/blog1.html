        <h2>Why I made this journal...</h2>
        <p>
            I made this tech journal to track my learning — not just what I learn, but how I feel about it. I started computer science without any background. I didn’t even know what HTML or GitHub was a few months ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            This journal gives me space to reflect, experiment, and build something that’s mine. It’s also helping me improve my front-end skills by actually building and designing something that grows with me.
          </p>

        <h2> What I’ve Learnt So Far:</h2>
        <p>How to write basic HTML and structure a page</p>
        <p>Linking external CSS and fonts using Google Fonts</p>
        <p>Hosting a website using GitHub Pages</p>
        <p>Creating and styling a sidebar</p>
        <p>Making a JavaScript tracker that responds to clicks using localstorage()</p>
      </section>

        <h2> Reflection on Building the Site</h2>
        <p>Building the site helped reinforce how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. I learned how to break down a page into sections and structure the layout cleanly.</p>
        <p>Styling was a challenge at first, especially making the sidebar and content boxes look right — but it taught me how to use CSS classes more effectively.</p>
        <p>I also had to troubleshoot small issues, like linking files correctly and making sure my GitHub Pages deployment updated properly.</p>
        <p>Using localStorage() in JavaScript was a turning point, it showed me how front-end features can store data and make a site feel more interactive.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2> Next Goals</h2>
        <p>Keep journaling weekly to track both skills and feelings</p>
        <p>Start learning basic back-end concepts (e.g. what servers and databases are)</p>
        <p>Try setting up a simple back-end using Node.js and Express</p>
