        <h3>Why I made this journal...</h3>
        <h4>This journal was to help me track my progress and reflect on what I did and and what im going to do next. I wanted to make this so that I could learn to HTML, CSS and javascript from this journal itself as I hosted it from scratch on Github pages. </h4>
        <p>
            I made this tech journal to track my learning — not just what I learn, but how I feel about it. I started computer science without any background. I didn’t even know what HTML or GitHub was a few months ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            This journal gives me space to reflect, experiment, and build something that’s mine. It’s also helping me improve my front-end skills by actually building and designing something that grows with me.
